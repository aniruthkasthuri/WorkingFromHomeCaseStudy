    "In this demonstration we will analyze data from a 2010 field experiment. Bloom et al. (2014) evaluate an experiment at Ctrip, China's largest travel agency. At the time of the study, the company had 16,000 employees and a $7 billion valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ctrip was considering allowing Working From Home (WFH) to save on office rent. However, they were worried that employees may not work as hard at home. To better understand what impact this policy would have, they ran an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The site for the experiment was Ctrip's airfare and hotel departments in Shanghai. These departments take calls and make bookings. Employees typically work 5 shifts a week in teams of about 15 people, plus a manager.\n",

    "We'll analyze the experiment Ctrip ran in the next section and provide more details on how the experiment worked. For now, you only need to know that:\n",
    "   * In order to qualify for WFH, employees must have their own room, broadband internet, and 6+ months of experience in their current position.\n",
    "   * After the experiment ended, all qualifying workers were given the option to WFH or in the office.\n",

    "At baseline, productivity in the treatment and control groups are quite similar. This is what we should expect under random assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, during the experiment period *large differences* in productivity emerge. In particular, `performance` is large in magnitude and *negative* in the control group. This indicates that, for whatever reason, average productivity was lower in the control group during the experiment period than in the baseline period. This might reflect that the experiment happened to coincide with a down period for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the `peformance` in the treatment group is mostly unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The difference in `performance` between the treatment and control groups reflects the *causal* effect of working from home on productivity. Our estimate for the causal effect of WFH is that it increases average performance by about 0.35 standard deviations.** This corresponds to about 15% more calls handled per day.\n",

    "\n",
    "The overall impact of WFH was quite positive. The firm improved productivity by between 20% to 30% and saved about\n",
    "$2,000 a year per employee that was working from home. These gains came from the reduction in required office space, improved employee performance, and reduced turnover. [We will discuss the turnover results in more detail when we discuss Attrition in Week 7.]\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of the experiment led Ctrip to offer the option to work from home to all qualifying employees. They also allowed treatment group employees to return to the office.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what was a surprise to management, despite the gains in performance, after the experiment half of treatment group employees decided to return to the office, and two thirds of the control group (who had earlier volunteered to work from hom) decided to stay in the office. The primary reason for switching was the concern over the loneliness and social isolation of working from home. Treatment group workers that performed badly while working at home were also more likely to switch back to office work.\n",
